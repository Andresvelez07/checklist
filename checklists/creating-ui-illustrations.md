- [ ] Define the design style   
You should always follow the current design style of the project, but in some cases, there might be no design style ready or you might be starting to a new project. In those cases the first thing you should do is the defining the design style by researching illustration design inspirations for the given project. 

- [ ] Create a moodboard  
We gather together all the inspiration, usually on a sketch file, and discuss the style with the design team.

- [ ] Draft illustrations  
After deciding on to the design style with the team, we create drafts of the illustrations, usually on the paper but sometimes we use iPads too.

- [ ] Get feedback  
It is always a good idea to take the drafts to non-design persons and gather their feedbacks.

- [ ] Decide upon the one to go with  

- [ ] Create high-fidelity illustration  
After agreed upon the design style with the team it is now time to create high-fidelity illustrations.

- [ ] Get feedback, again  
Even if you have agreed upon the design style of the illustrations, the high-fidelity illustrations might need feedbacks again. 

- [ ] Integrate the illustration(s) to the UI  
You should integrate the illustrations to the UI design project and don't forget to create the appropriate symbols on the Sketch file.
