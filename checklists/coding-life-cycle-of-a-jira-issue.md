- [ ] Read acceptance criteria carefully  
Be sure all cases covered. Even you already discussed the issue with the team, some new cases may come up your mind. Don't hesitate to discuss AC one more time.

- [ ] Create a branch for the issue  
You should create a branch with name `feature/ABC-123_brief-description`. For bugs change `feature` with `bug` keyword.

- [ ] Push your branch to remote immediately
Since we have Jira-GitHub integration, you have to push the branch to remote in order to trigger "In Progress" transition

- [ ] Start time tracker  
You need to log your work time. You can use [Chronos](https://chronos.web-pal.com) or [Clockify](https://clockify.me). You can also manually log it from Jira interface.

- [ ] Write the code ðŸ‘Š  
You always commit changes with a meaningful scope. Commit should contain just one task at a time. Therefore, all commits must be revertable

- [ ] Make sure you added necessary tests

- [ ] Make sure there is no any linting or formatting error

- [ ] Make sure you aren't below the coverage threshold

- [ ] Push your changes

- [ ] Create a new PR
You may mention the issue name on PR title.

- [ ] Assign relevant people to PR

- [ ] Stop the timer
