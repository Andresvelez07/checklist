description: Creating interactive prototypes is an important step in the product design process. Use this checklist to make sure you cover the basics of creating them!
---

- [ ] Create the screens  
These screens don't have to be high-fidelity designs.

- [ ] Wire them up  
Make sure you have linked every screen to each other so that ther are no gaps in interactions.

- [ ] Pay attention to component behaviours  
For better prototyping you should pay extra attention to component states and their behaviours. E.g. sticky components, hover and active effects, micro-interactions...

- [ ] Test the usability of the product  
E.g. Make sure the buttons are easily noticable and clickable. Texts are easy to read, etc.

- [ ] Create user personas  
Create user personas compatible to the project's targets.

- [ ] Test the design as a user  
Get on to the shoes of the personas you have created and use the product as if you were the user.

- [ ] Try out different use cases
