- [ ] Fill the water tank if needed  
Just like anyone else in the industry, we drink coffee a LOT! So filling water tank is a biggie.

- [ ] Set the desired strongness  
Our machine has so much to choose from. Select the one for your taste.

- [ ] Use the button for either one shot or double shot  

- [ ] Press the hot water button if you'd like an Americano  

- [ ] Clean the espresso machine afterwards  
Enjoy!
