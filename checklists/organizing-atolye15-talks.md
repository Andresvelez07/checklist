---
- [ ] Research about current trend topics initially.  
Research and find trending topics on web development and design, agile development and lifestyle concepts that may be applicable to our niche audience.

- [ ]  Get together with the team to plan who'll be willing to host the next meetup.    
The meetup line-up consists of guest speakers and our team members so first we should talk on who wants to host a meetup about subjects we are experts on; UI/UX design, web and mobile development, and project management. Compile a list of speakers and create a calendar for upcoming meetups.

- [ ]  Get in touch with the guest speaker if there is one and make necessary arrangements.  
If there is to be a guest speaker on the meetup, we should make everything ready for his/her visit and the setup.

- [ ]  Create media on Meetup and Kommunity and post announcements on social media channels.    
Weeks prior to the meetup, publish meeetup on Meetup and Kommunity, letting audience to reserve their seats, and provide them with necessary information like location, time, attendee limit and instructions. After publishing the meetup, prepare social media content with designers and post them on social media channels and track what's going on.(The guidelines and templates are already on designer Sketch files)

- [ ]  Make necessary arrangements on the meetup day.  
According to the time plan, make the setup ready 1-hour prior to the meetup and welcome guests; making sure the lights, the presentation setup and the cameras are ready.

- [ ]  During meetup, live stream and share snaps on Instagram stories; later on remember to pin them on meetup stories.    
Meetups are a great way to communicate what's being shared pyhsically with the audience in the room to the digital media via socia media channels, so we make sure that we have live content on our Instagram stories as well.

- [ ]  Tips for sharing on Instagram  
We share our content on a standardized outline which already takes place on our Instagram account on pinned stories. "Atolye15talks" uses the hashtag #atolye15talks, and we make sure to have a short and descriptive title of the meetup involved on the images.
