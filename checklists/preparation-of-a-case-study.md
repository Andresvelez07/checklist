-  [ ] Set up a meeting with the team  
Case Study preparation requires work hand-in-hand with development, design and project management teams as well, so make sure you gather them altogether!

-  [ ] Draft the crucial parts and must-have points of the case study in the meeting  
There are various concepts to take into consideration when drafting a new case study so we have to clarify them beforehand to get the assistance needed from development and design.

-  [ ] Provide general information  
To start off the case study, make sure that you have a beautifully outlined abstract before diving into challenges and solutions.

- [ ] Evaluate the project with Project Management team   
Following the collection of information for the case study, get together with the PM team to cover all steps of the project, starting from day 1 to going live.

- [ ] Identify the challenges, goals and provide your solution that led you to success on the project    
Use data to illustrate your key points and identify the challenges the team has faced, and the solutions provided to achieve success on the project.

- [ ] Finalize the content and support it with images, videos or animated GIFs  
Create a file of images or digital content you'd like to include in the case study to visually showcase your study better.

- [ ] Publish on related channels and export multiple versions to use in social media channels, company portfolios and presentations  
Publish your case study on the related social media channels, such as Behance, Clutch, Dribbble and then gather feedback to strengthen your case study game.
