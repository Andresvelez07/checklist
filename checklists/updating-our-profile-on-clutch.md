- [ ]  Update existing profile upon every new project.  
Our Clutch profile is updated with new descriptive content and images every time we work on a new project, and it is both the profile page and the company portfolio page.

- [ ]  Request reviews from clients, ghostwrite them if need be.  
We have clients from all over the world and their opinions and feedback means the world to us. On Clutch we have our client references and reviews collected by Clutch team via phone or online interviews, and we encourage and help our clients give us reviews as much as we can by following these steps.

- [ ]  Send a "Thank you" e-mail or call clients after the review has been published.  
We always stay in close contact with our clients, and to thank them after they give us a review is a way of letting them know of our appreciation.
