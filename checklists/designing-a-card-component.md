description: One of the most needed elements of almost every UI is card components, there are some to-do's to follow for our standards.
---

- [ ] Define the need(s) of the card  
Cards mostly serves to one purpose only and for every purpose we should have different cards.

- [ ] Use white space wisely  
This to-do applies to designing any UI element. 

- [ ] Use 8pt grid  
We use 8pt grid system on our projects, our most used spacings measure; 2pt, 4pt, 8pt, 16pt, 24pt, 32pt, 40pt, 48pt, 64pt, 96pt. We sometimes also have 6pt and 12pt. 

- [ ] Add needed elements  
Cards can get elements like images, text, list groups, links, buttons and more. Add the necessary elements to your card.

- [ ] Design it's states  
Cards are interactive UI elements, so there might be need of the hover, active and focus states.

- [ ] Add real data  
Designing with real data is much better than designing with dummy text you should always check your elements with real content.
  
- [ ] Name the card properly  
Naming UI elements is very important, you should follow the project's current naming convention if there is one or create a semantic naming convention and follow it. E.g. Cards / Checklist / Large / Idle

- [ ] Add card to project's style guide  
You might want to refer to [Essentials of UI Style Guide](/checklist/essentials-of-ui-style-guide) Checklist.
