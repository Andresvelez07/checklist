- [ ] Check dependencies in the composer.json file  
Make sure the development and production dependencies are correctly defined and production release does not include development packages

- [ ] Check the environment variables  
Check the environment variables defined in `.env` file to prevent a leak of any sensitive information and make sure this file only includes example values

- [ ] Test the Makefile is running as it should for all environment definitions  
Once again, make sure the `Makefile` is running correctly for all the environments defined for the project

- [ ] Open a pull request to the environment's base branch  
Open a pull request from the development branch which contains all the branches that have been completed their [coding life-cycle](/checklist/coding-life-cycle-of-a-jira-issue) to the environment's base branch

- [ ] Define environment values on server  
If any newly defined environment values exist in `.env` file, make sure they are defined in the `.env.local` with correct values on the target server or continuous deployment tool.

- [ ] Merge approved pull request  
Then wait for the deployment tool while you enjoy a sip of your ‚òïÔ∏è

- [ ] Test the application to make sure it is deployed successfully
