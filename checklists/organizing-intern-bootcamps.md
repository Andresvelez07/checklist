Intern bootcamps are organized twice a year; Spring and Autumn, and it's important to be aligned with its preparations on marketing side.

We need to prepare for the intern bootcamp with the design team to make the content ready. There will be announcement posts, sponsored content, prints and mailings we need to take care of.

- [ ]  Mark calendar for social media posts and share them on the regular until the day of Intern Bootcamp.   
We post announcement content for the applications, then when the applications are over, and we post reminder images regularly on Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook.

- [ ]  During Intern Bootcamp, share snaps on Instagram stories; later on remember to pin them on meetup stories.  
Besides sharing constanly on social media, work hand-in-hand with the production and photography team to constantly get newest images and keep Instagram updated.

We share our content on a standardized outline which already takes place on our Instagram account on pinned stories. We use the hashtag #atolye15stajkampi, and we make sure to have a short and descriptive title of the bootcamp involved on the images.
