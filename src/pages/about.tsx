            We love to automate anything if it can be automated. For the things we canâ€™t automate
            (yet) we have a protocol. These protocols standardise our workflow so that everyone in
            AtÃ¶lye15 works on a standard.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have been designing, developing & managing projects that vary in size for over 10
            years now. Working on a different scale projects brought us some priceless experiences
            that led us to a greater success on the following projects. We updated our workflow, the
            way we work, even the hours we work. We try to adapt to the ongoing growth on technology
            and we are always on track with keeping our protocols updated.
          </p>

          <p>
            This was an internal tool that we still use on every department but weâ€™ve decided to
            share this with the community so that we can help each other out, please feel free to
            suggest a checklist or an improvement on a checklist (on its own page). We will consider
            every suggestion and implement the ones that we think fits our needs and the way we
            work.
